My Custom John D'oh VoiceAttack Macros and Profile for Star Citizen.

[Install Voice Attack](https://voiceattack.com)

## The Basics
If you have your own VoiceAttack macros, make sure you backup everything before you mess with this stuff!

This is made to be a standalone voice attack profile, that works by itself, and does not use the HCS Event Horizon profile whatsoever.  I have tried to create it as it's own profile, because when i was trying to get more fine detail in the custom profile I was making, the HCS Event Horizon profile kept getting in the way. Very annoying! As such, this profile uses a lot of custom keyboard hotkeys in Star Citizen. so you will need to download the layout_NerdyJohnDohVAP_exported.xml keyboard profile, Keep in mind that it also contains my custom HOSAS profile as well. 

Also the custom navigation and maintenance functions in this profile are from [Chadarius](https://github.com/Chadarius/StarCitizenVoiceAtk), Please be sure to show him a lot of love, these functions are amazing. Also to keep the flow of the Instructions similar to Chadarius' instructions I have used his readme as a starting point, so if you see the similarities, that's why. His is very clean and concise. 

## Create New Profile
First create a new profile to hold the John D'oh macros for Star Citizen. I created a new profile named "Nerdy John". 

Next create a second profile to hold the resolution independent initialization variables. I named mine "Nerdy Init".

## Import the Commands
Select the new profile "Nerdy John" (or whatever you named it) and click the edit button. Then click the import commands button and import the "TheNerdyGentleman John D'oh-Profile.vap" that you downloaded earlier.

Then select the new init profile "Nerdy Init" (or whatever you named it) and click the edit button. Then click the import commands button and import the "TheNerdyGentleman Init-Profile.vap" that you downloaded earlier.

## Include Commands From Other Profiles

Then select the "Nerdy John" profile. Under Options, you should set "Include commands from other profiles:" and add the "Nerdy Init" profiles there.

## Setup your Command Name
I setup my code word to act as the Command Name for VoiceAttack. Its like saying "OK Google", "Alexa", or "Siri" to talk your phones/devices.

Click the Options button on your "Nerdy John" VoiceAttack Profile. Check "Override listening if my spoken command begins with:" and set a command word. I use "John". You can use any word you want, but I suggest making it at least a two sylable easy to pronounce and understand word. This keeps your ship "AI" from accidently responding to conversations or things like the TV in the background. When you start Voice Attack, just tell it to "go to sleep" to stop listening except for anything following your command word.

## Mouse targeting and Resolution

The Mouse Targeting and Resolution information used in this profile were created by the amazing YouTube creator [Chadarius](https://github.com/Chadarius/StarCitizenVoiceAtk). Please visit his Github repository for more information pertaining to the Mouse Targeting and Navigation systems.
